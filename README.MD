This repository contains the code of the paper *Generalized Dynamic Brain Functional Connectivity Based on Random Convolutions*.

The exp directory includes two sets of experimental code, corresponding to simulated data and real data, respectively.

The models directory comprises four methods: the Random Convolution method, the MTD method, the Phase Synchronization method, and the Sliding Window method.

The elbow.py script implements the elbow method and provides its visualization.

The imports directory lists the required dependency packages.

The utils directory contains utility functions used throughout the project.

The project is compatible with Python 3.11.

More details are included in the paper.

Thank you.
